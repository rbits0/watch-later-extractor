# Watch Later Extractor
[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script to export videos from your YouTube Watch Later page to a JSON file

## Usage
Go to your [Watch Later](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL) and wait for the page to load. Then click Run script in the Tampermonkey menu, and wait.

Disabling images may make the process faster. To do this in Firefox, head to [about:config](about:config) and set `permissions.default.image` to `2` (make sure to set it back to default once you're done).
